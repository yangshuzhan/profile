This is the first day editing my profile, because I'm looking for a Phd and I've sent a couple of emails recently. Few of them get responded unfortunately, and I realized the reason may be I don't showcase enough although I did many things actually. Maybe it's time to organize those work and record them.

I tried many times but there's some bugs and somehow the blog doesn't show.
