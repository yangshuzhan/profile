I worked with Professor Jian Chen on Virtual Colonoscopy. https://yangshuzhan.github.io/viewer/viewer2.html

Virtual colonoscopy, also known as CT colonography, is a non-invasive medical imaging procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for polyps, cancer, and other abnormalities. Unlike traditional colonoscopy, which uses a flexible tube with a camera inserted into the rectum, virtual colonoscopy relies on computed tomography (CT) scans to create detailed 3D images of the colon.
